# Housing-Price-Prediction
A simple Linear Regression model to predict the the values of the houses in difference locations using the location information.


- This is a simple model for predicting the prices of the houses. The more concentration is towards the EDA part (Exploratory Data Analysis) and the Data cleaning part. 
- This brings us to the real-life challenges of the uncleaned dataset and brings us to the point, where and how we can deal with the missing values of the dataset and which of the features are highly correlated.
